This tool allows you to quickly test your memory.

This is a process involving the following steps:
- Generating 1 GB of random data into your RAM
- Saving the data to disk
- Compressing the data into an archive
- Extracting the data off the archive
- Re-importing the data into memory
- Comparing the imported data with the previous data that is still stored into your RAM

### Don't use this as an extensive memory test. This test is designed to simply test whether this task survives, since errors in compression and decompression are frequent with bad RAM overclocks.
